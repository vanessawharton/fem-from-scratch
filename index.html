            Mushroom foraging is the art and science of identifying and
            collecting wild mushrooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a practice that combines outdoor exploration, botanical
            knowledge, and culinary adventure. Foragers venture into forests,
            fields, and even urban green spaces to discover these hidden
            treasures.

          <p>
            But beware – this hobby requires careful study and respect for
            nature, as some mushrooms can be dangerous if misidentified.
